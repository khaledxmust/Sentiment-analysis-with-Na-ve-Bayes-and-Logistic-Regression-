# Sentiment analysis with (Naïve Bayes and Logistic-Regression)
Sentiment analysis (Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression) with different vectorizers + ngrams

Providing a data file called ‘Airline-Sentiment.csv’. Use 70% of the provided data as training data and the remaining 30% to test a classifier. To split the data, use the appropriate python function while setting the random state to 0.

After splitting the data, we will build a various models:

1. CountVectorizer + Naïve Bayes Multinomial

2. TFIDFVectorizer + Naïve Bayes Multinomial

3. CountVectorizer with uni-grams and bi-grams + Naïve Bayes Multinomial

4. CountVectorizer + Logistic Regression

5. TFIDFVectorizer + Logistic Regression

6. CountVectorizer with uni-grams and bi-grams + Logistic Regression
